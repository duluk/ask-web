# ask-web

## Description

The utility everyone has written for themselves, a basic CLI tool for asking LLMs questions without bothering with a mouse.

Full disclosure: this is my second Go project. I mainly write in Ruby, C and Python. This was generated by Gemini 2.0, then modified and expanded by me.

## Building

Go:

```bash
$ go mod tidy
$ go build cmd/ask-web/main.go
```

Or, as I'm doing now (bc I'm old):
```bash
$ make
```

## Installation

```bash
$ make install # $GO_PATH
```

## Usage

#### Set the API Key
1. The following keys are required:
* OpenAI for LLM summary (OPENAI_API_KEY)
* Google API for web search (GOOGLE_API_KEY)
* Google Custom Search Engine ID for web search (GOOGLE_CSE_ID)

1. Put the keys in the following files located in `$HOME/.config/ask-web/`:
* openai-api-key
* google-api-key
* google-cse-id

#### Send a Query
```bash
$ ask-web "What's the most popular chess opening in 2024?"
```

* Use top `n` website results:
```bash
$ ask-web -n 5 "What is the current political climate in the United States?"
```

### [NOTE]
> This is a work in progress and not all functionality has been added.
