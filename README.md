# ask-web

## Description

The utility everyone has written for themselves, a basic CLI tool for asking LLMs questions without bothering with a mouse.

Full disclosure: this is my second Go project. I mainly write in Ruby, C and Python. This was generated by Gemini 2.0, then modified and expanded by me.

## Building

Go:

```bash
$ go mod tidy
$ go build cmd/ask-web/main.go
```

Or, as I'm doing now (bc I'm old):
```bash
$ make
```

## Installation

```bash
$ make install # $GO_PATH
```

## Usage

#### Set the Keys
1. For Searching
    * DuckDuckGo
        - No key required
    * Google
        - API
          - Env: GOOGLE_API_KEY
          - File: `$HOME/.config/ask-web/google-api-key`
        - Custom Search ID
          - Env: GOOGLE_CSE_ID
          - File: `$HOME/.config/ask-web/google-cse-id`
    * Bing
      - API
        - Env: BING_API_KEY
        - File: `$HOME/.config/ask-web/bing-api-key`
      - Config
        - Env: BING_CONFIG_KEY
        - File: `$HOME/.config/ask-web/bing-config-key`
2. For Summarization
    * ChatGPT (OpenAI)
      - Env: OPENAI_API_KEY
      - File: `$HOME/.config/ask-web/openai-api-key`
    * Others coming soon...

*Note*: setting up those search engine keys is beyond the scope of this README. IMHO it's not as straightforward as it could be if you haven't done it before.

#### Send a Query
```bash
$ ask-web "What's the most popular chess opening in 2024?"
```

* Use top `n` website results:
```bash
$ ask-web -n 5 "What is the current political climate in the United States?"
```

  - **N.B.** Currently, `n` will be used for each search engine being used
